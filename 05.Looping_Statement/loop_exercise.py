### Loop Exercise

# 1. check the prime no given from the user


# 2. Accept n number from user and calculate the sum of all number between 1 and n including n


# 3. Display numbers which are divisible by 5 and if you find number greater than 150 stop the loop iteration


# 4. Given a number count the total number of digits in a number


# 5. Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers


# 6. Find Factorial of a Number


# 7. Generate Multiplication Table


# 8. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50. 
#    Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
#    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
#   Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
#   Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34


# 9. Find GCD of two Numbers


# 10. Find LCM of two Numbers


# 11. Display Characters from A to Z Using Loop


# 12. Reverse a Number


# 13. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included). 


# 14. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9. 
# Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.


# 15. Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.

# 16. Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it. 


# 17. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers. 
# Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 
# Expected Output :
# Number of even numbers : 5
# Number of odd numbers : 4




# 18. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
# Note : Use 'continue' statement.
# Expected Output : 0 1 2 4 5


# 19. Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters.


# 20. Write a Python program to check the validity of password input by users. 
# Validation :
# At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
# At least 1 number between [0-9].
# At least 1 character from [$#@].
# Minimum length 6 characters.
# Maximum length 16 characters.


# 21. Write a Python program to find numbers between 100 and 400 (both included) where each digit of a number is an even number. 
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence.
