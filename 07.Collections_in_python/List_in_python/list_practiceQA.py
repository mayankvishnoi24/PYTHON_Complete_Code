# 1. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list

# l = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# s = 0
# for i in l:
#     s = s + i
# print("Sum",s)
# print(sum(l))


# 2. Write a Python program to multiplies all the items in a list. 

# m = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# s = 1
# for i in m:
#     s = s * i
# print("Multiplication",s)


# 3. Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list. 

# 4. Write a Python program to get the smallest number from a list. 

# 5. Write a Python program to count the number of strings where the string length is 2 or more and the first and last character are same from a given list of strings. 
# Sample List : ['abc', 'xyz', 'aba', '1221']
# Expected Result : 2

# l = ['abc', 'xyz', 'aba', '1221']
# count = 0
# for i in l:
#     if len(i)>=2 and i[0]==i[-1]:
#         count += 1
# print(count)

# 10. Write a Python program that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member. 

# 11. Write a Python program to print a specified list after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th elements. 
# Sample List : ['Red', 'Green', 'White', 'Black', 'Pink', 'Yellow']
# Expected Output : ['Green', 'White', 'Black']

# l = ['Red', 'Green', 'White', 'Black', 'Pink', 'Yellow']
# l.pop(5)
# print(l)
# l.pop(4)
# print(l)
# l.pop(0)
# print(l)


# 12. Write a Python program to generate a 3*4*6 3D array whose each element is *. 

# l3 = []
# for k in range(3):
#     l2 = []
#     for j in range(4):
#         l1 = []
#         for i in range(6):
#             l3.append("*")
#         l2.append(l1)
#     l1.append(l2)

# print(l3)

# 14. Write a python program to print the list in square of the list elements.

# l = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,7,5,4]]
# l1 = []
# for i in l:
#     l2 = []
#     for j in i:
#         l2.append(j**2)
#     l1.append(l2)

# print(l1)
